# TLE-ELiminators-CP-31
This repository contains the solved problems from the CP-31 sheet made by Priyansh Agarwal and team from TLE Eliminators. 

## Why is it not complete?
I am an enthusiastic coder, trying to get into competitive programming, and found the [CP-31 sheet from TLE eliminators]([url](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet)) very usefull. I will be uploading the solutions in C++ as soon as I complete them.

If you want to upload solutions which are not uploaded yet or in a different programming language, then feel free to raise a merge request. 

Happy coding
