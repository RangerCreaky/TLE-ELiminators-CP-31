# CP-31 sheet by TLE Eliminators
HI!
This repository is meant to contain the solutions of the [CP-31 sheet]([url](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet)) created and maintained by Pryiansh Agarwal and team from TLE eliminators

## Why is it not complete
So I am an enthusiastic coder, just getting into competitive programming. In my journey I found this sheet very usefull. I will be uploading the solutions as soon as I complete them.

If any of you wants to add explainations, optimizations, solutions which are not already pushed or in a new language, then do push your changes to this repo and raise a merge request.

If there are any issues with the existing code do raise the issue, and figure it out together

Happy coding
